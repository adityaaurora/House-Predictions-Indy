# House-Predictions-Indy
Prediction model of house prices in Indianapolis area

I used data from zillow, and the US Federal Reserve
The data I used from the reserve was the CPI for inflation measure, rental vacancy rate, mortgage percentage rates
Zillow data consisted of median house price and median house value

I used a random forest classifier that returned around 73% accuracy. The accuracy was improved from 60% by including 
yearly ratio variables for mortgate rates, CPI, and rental vacancy rates. The data cleaning was done inside the notebook and it is listed with each step in the notebook.
